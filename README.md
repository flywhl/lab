# lab
A CLI tool for managing computational science

**Work in progress - Not ready for use!**

## Usage

Running `lab run .` will search for a `Labfile` in the directory, and then run the experiments defined there. `lab`
will automatically resolve dependencies between experiments and run them in the right order.
